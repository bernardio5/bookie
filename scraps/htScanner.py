make a web page for each book. 
don't worry about indexing! we make the index later
also, we know where everything is.

there will be a directory tree.
the tree will look a lot like PGs
you will use the gbid to find a book.

you want to use th pgid; unique one-to-one for books.

the web page shows cover, title, author, subjects. 
also a link to the epub itself


the 18-inch section
1 other books by author
2 other books in topic
3 nearby topics


dir structure for all books
root
  first digit 10 -> 5500 books each
    second digit -> 550 books each
      third digit -> 55 each? maybe skip? 
        bookdirs

there is a dir for each book. 

it contains : html page, cover.jpg, epub
anything else? 

pfft: this is just a reskin of the PG page. 
well.. to start, right? 



author pages? info is all in the books page


how to search by topic

1) a list of all topics, 
2) processed for indexing and skipping around? 
    sort words by rarity, sort letters of word 
    8 entries per topic, flipping order of first 3 words around
3) misspellings? sort letters, then show nearest
4) broken into 100 text files, with an index file


how to search by author
abc list, 
a list of common misspellings?
