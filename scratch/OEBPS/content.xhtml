  <h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

  <p>Before this book was printed, I thoughtlessly concluded there must be a
  preface; but, on consideration, see no particular purpose it would answer,
  and gladly decline a task I should have undertaken with much timidity and
  reluctance. All I feel necessary to premise, is, that the tale in the Old
  Shepherd's Recollections is founded on an event which happened in Ireland;
  and that last spring I suppressed the song ending in page 65 <span class=
  "comment">[The Old Man's Farewell]</span>, some time after it had been in
  the hands of the composer, from meeting accidentally with a quotation in a
  magazine that resembled it.</p>

  <h2><a name="p01" id="p01"></a>THE OLD FISHERMAN.</h2>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'My bosom is chill'd with the cold,</p>

      <p class="i2">My limbs their lost vigour deplore!</p>

      <p>Alas! to the lonely and old,</p>

      <p class="i2">Hope warbles her promise no more!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Worn out with the length of my way,</p>

      <p class="i2">I must rest me awhile on the beach,</p>

      <p>To feel the salt dash of the spray,</p>

      <p class="i2">If haply so far it may reach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'As the white-foaming billows arise,</p>

      <p class="i2">I reflect on the days that are past,</p>

      <p>When the pride of my strength could despise</p>

      <p class="i2">The keen-driving force of the blast.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Though the heavens might menace on high,</p>

      <p class="i2">I would still push my vessel from shore;</p>

      <p>At my calling undauntedly ply,</p>

      <p class="i2">And sing as I handled the oar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'When fortune rewarded my toil,</p>

      <p class="i2">And my nets, deeply-laden, I drew,</p>

      <p>I hurried me home with the spoil,</p>

      <p class="i2">And its inmates rejoic'd at the view.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Though the winds and the waves were perverse,</p>

      <p class="i2">I was sure to be welcom'd with glee;</p>

      <p>My presence the cares would disperse,</p>

      <p class="i2">That were only awaken'd for me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Whether weary, with toiling in vain,</p>

      <p class="i2">Or gay, from abundant success,</p>

      <p>I heard the same blessing again,&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">I met the same tender caress:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'I fancied the perils repay'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">That could such affection ensure;</p>

      <p>By fondness and gratitude sway'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">I was eager to dare and endure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'My cot did each comfort contain,</p>

      <p class="i2">And that gave my bosom delight;</p>

      <p>When drench'd by the winterly rain,</p>

      <p class="i2">I watch'd in my vessel at night.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'But, alas! from the tyrant, Disease,</p>

      <p class="i2">What love or what caution can save!</p>

      <p>A fever, more harsh than the seas,</p>

      <p class="i2">Consign'd my poor wife to the grave.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'My children, so tenderly rear'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">And pining for want of her care,</p>

      <p>Though more by my sorrows endear'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">Could not rescue my heart from despair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'I tempted the dangers of night,</p>

      <p class="i2">And still labour'd hard at the oar,</p>

      <p>My sufferings appear'd to be light,</p>

      <p class="i2">But I suffer'd with pleasure no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'And yet, when some seasons had roll'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">I seem'd to awaken anew;</p>

      <p>My children I lov'd to behold,</p>

      <p class="i2">How tall and how comely they grew.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'My boy became hardy and bold,</p>

      <p class="i2">His spirit was buoyant and free;</p>

      <p>And, as I grew thoughtful and old,</p>

      <p class="i2">Was loud and oppressive to me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'But the girl, like a bird in the bower,</p>

      <p class="i2">Awaken'd my hope and my pride;</p>

      <p>She won on my heart ev'ry hour,</p>

      <p class="i2">And I could not the preference hide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'I mark'd the address and the care,</p>

      <p class="i2">The manner endearing and mild,</p>

      <p>Not dreaming those qualities rare</p>

      <p class="i2">Were to murther the peace of my child:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'That grandeur would ever descend</p>

      <p class="i2">To seek for so lowly a bride,</p>

      <p>Or his fair one, a lover pretend,</p>

      <p class="i2">From all she held dear to divide:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'That beauty was priz'd like a gem,</p>

      <p class="i2">Expected to dazzle and shine,</p>

      <p>Whose value the world would contemn,</p>

      <p class="i2">Unless trac'd to some Indian mine:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Alas! hapless girl! had I known</p>

      <p class="i2">Thou hadst learnt to repine at thy lot;</p>

      <p>That splendour and rank were thy own,</p>

      <p class="i2">Thy home and thy father forgot:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'That lore and ambition assail'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">Thou hadst left us, whatever befel!</p>

      <p>My pardon and prayers had prevail'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">I had blest thee, and bade thee farewel!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'With thy husband, from this happy clime,</p>

      <p class="i2">I had seen thee for ever depart!</p>

      <p>Still hoping affection and time</p>

      <p class="i2">Might soften the pride of his heart:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'That a moment perhaps would arise,</p>

      <p class="i2">When, fondling a child on the knee,</p>

      <p>He might read, in its innocent eyes</p>

      <p class="i2">A lesson of pity for me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'But lips, which till then never said</p>

      <p class="i2">A word to cause any one pain,</p>

      <p>Inform'd me, when reason had fled,</p>

      <p class="i2">Of a conflict it could not sustain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'And he, who had wish'd to conceal</p>

      <p class="i2">That the woman he lov'd had been poor,</p>

      <p>Began all his folly to feel,</p>

      <p class="i2">When the victim could hearken no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Yet still for himself did he mourn,</p>

      <p class="i2">And, indignant, I fled from the view:</p>

      <p>For my wrongs were not easily borne,</p>

      <p class="i2">And my anger was hard to subdue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'One prop, one sole comfort, remain'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">Who saw me o'erladen with grief,</p>

      <p>Who saw (though I never complain'd)</p>

      <p class="i2">My heart was too sick for relief.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'One, who always attentive and dear,</p>

      <p class="i2">Every effort exerted to please,</p>

      <p>My desolate prospect to cheer,</p>

      <p class="i2">To study my health and my ease.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'For his was each toil and each care,</p>

      <p class="i2">The due observations to keep;</p>

      <p>To sit watching amid the night air,</p>

      <p class="i2">And fancy his father asleep.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Yet, dejected, and sadly forlorn,</p>

      <p class="i2">I dar'd in my heart to repine,&mdash;</p>

      <p>To lament that I ever was born,</p>

      <p class="i2">Though such worth and affection were mine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Alas! I was destin'd to know,</p>

      <p class="i2">However intense my despair,</p>

      <p>I still was reserv'd for a blow,</p>

      <p class="i2">More painful and cruel to bear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Yes! this only one fell in the main!</p>

      <p class="i2">&mdash;I eagerly struggled to save;</p>

      <p>But I strove with the current in vain,</p>

      <p class="i2">And saw him sink under the wave!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'My head was astounded and wild,&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">Incessant I roam'd on the shore,</p>

      <p>To seek the dead corse of my child,</p>

      <p class="i2">And to weep on his bosom once more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Seven days undisturb'd was the sky,</p>

      <p class="i2">The eighth was a tempest most drear,</p>

      <p>I saw the huge billow rise high!</p>

      <p class="i2">I saw my lost treasure appear!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Like a dream it seem'd passing away:&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">I hurried me onward to meet,</p>

      <p>And clasp the inanimate clay,</p>

      <p class="i2">When senseless I sunk at his feet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'These hands, now enfeebled by time,</p>

      <p class="i2">The last pious offices paid!</p>

      <p>Age sorrow'd o'er youth in its prime,</p>

      <p class="i2">And my boy near his mother was laid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Now scar'd by the griefs I have known,</p>

      <p class="i2">Wounds, apathy only can heal,</p>

      <p>My joys and my sorrows are flown,</p>

      <p class="i2">For I have forgotten to feel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'But I know my Creator is just,</p>

      <p class="i2">That his hand will deliver me soon;</p>

      <p>I have learnt to submit and to trust,</p>

      <p class="i2">Though I finish my journey alone.'</p>

  <h2><a name="p02" id="p02"></a>LINES TO MRS. RADCLIFFE,</h2>

  <h3>ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.</h3>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Enchantress! whose transcendant pow'rs,</p>

      <p class="i2">With ease, the massy fabric raise;&mdash;</p>

      <p>Beneath whose sway the tempest low'rs,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Accept the tribute of a heart,</p>

      <p class="i2">Which thou hast often made to glow</p>

      <p>With transport, oft with terror start,</p>

      <p class="i2">Or sink at strains of solemn woe!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Invention, like a falcon, tam'd</p>

      <p class="i2">By some expert and daring hand,</p>

      <p>For pride, for strength and fierceness fam'd,</p>

      <p class="i2">Implicit yields to thy command.</p>

      <p>Now mounts aloft in soaring flight,</p>

      <p>Shoots, like a star, beyond the sight;</p>

      <p>Or, in capricious windings borne,</p>

      <p>Mocks our faint hopes of safe return;</p>

      <p>Delights in trackless paths to roam,</p>

      <p>But hears thy call, and hurries home;</p>

      <p>Checks his bold wing when tow'ring free,</p>

      <p>And sails, without a pause, to thee!</p>

      <p>When spirits in thy circle rise,</p>

      <p class="i2">Gaunt Wonder, panic-struck, and pale,</p>

      <p>Impatient Hope, and dread Surmise,</p>

      <p class="i2">Attendants on the mystic tale!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>How is it, with such vivid hues,</p>

      <p class="i2">A harmonizing softness flows!</p>

      <p class="i2">Such grandeur as thy pencil throws!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Say! do the nymphs of classic lore,</p>

      <p class="i2">So simply graceful, light, and fair,</p>

      <p>Forsake their consecrated shore,</p>

      <p class="i2">Their hallow'd groves, and purer air?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tir'd of the ancient Grecian loom,</p>

      <p class="i2">The high-wrought fiction of Romance?</p>

      <p>While the dark Genius of our northern clime,</p>

      <p class="i2">And moves majestic through recoiling clouds!</p>

      <p>O yes! they own the wond'rous spell,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Each fiction under their command,</p>

  <h3>THE DAY AFTER IT HAD BEEN GIVEN BY MISS PONSONBY.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Soft blushing flow'r! my bosom grieves,</p>

      <p>To view thy sadly drooping leaves:</p>

      <p>For, while their tender tints decay,</p>

      <p>The rose of Fancy fades away!</p>

      <p>As pilgrims, who, with zealous care,</p>

      <p>Some little treasur'd relic bear,</p>

      <p>To re-assure the doubtful mind,</p>

      <p>When pausing memory looks behind;</p>

      <p>I, from a more enlighten'd shrine,</p>

      <p>Had made this sweet memento mine:</p>

      <p>It folds the pallid leaf, and pines,</p>

      <p>As mourning the unhappy doom,</p>

      <p>Which tears it from so sweet a home!</p>

      <p>Forlornly I wander, forlornly I sigh,</p>

      <p>Nor by honours, by wealth, nor by power am I caught;</p>

      <p>There are many who tell me my station is blest.</p>

      <p>How keen and how anxious I cannot express,</p>

      <p>My happiness was once a goodly tree,</p>

      <p class="i2">Which promis'd every day to grow more fair,</p>

      <p class="i2">And rear'd its lofty branches in the air,</p>

      <p>In sooth, it was a pleasant sight, to see!</p>

      <p>Amidst, fair honey-suckles crept along,</p>

      <p class="i2">Twin'd round the bark, and hung from every bough,</p>

      <p>While birds, which Fancy held by slender strings,</p>

      <p>Plum'd the dark azure of their shining wings,</p>

      <p class="i2">Or dipp'd them in the silver stream below,</p>

      <p>With many a joyful note, and many a song!</p>

      <p>When lo! a tempest hurtles in the sky!</p>

      <p class="i2">While the scar'd songsters leave the quiv'ring bough,</p>

      <p class="i2">Their shelter henceforth seems but insecure;</p>

      <p class="i2">The winged tribes disdain the frequent lure,</p>

      <p>Where many a songster lies benumb'd or dead;</p>

      <p>Dear boy, when you meet with a rose,</p>

      <p>A Pilgrim weary, toil-subdued,</p>

      <p>I reach'd a country, strange and rude,</p>

      <p>And trembled, lest approaching eve</p>

      <p>My hope of shelter might deceive;</p>

      <p>When I espied a hunter train,</p>

      <p>Prowling at leisure o'er the plain,</p>

      <p>And hasten'd on to ask relief,</p>

      <p>Of the ill-omen'd, haughty chief.</p>

      <p>His eye was artful, keen, and bold,</p>

      <p>His smile malevolently cold,</p>

      <p>And had not all my fire been fled,</p>

      <p>And every earthly passion dead,</p>

      <p>His pity to contempt allied,</p>

      <p>Had rous'd my anger and my pride;</p>

      <p>But, as it was, I bent my way,</p>

      <p>Where his secluded mansion lay,</p>

      <p>Which rose before my eyes at length,</p>

      <p>A fortress of determin'd strength,</p>

      <p>And layers of every colour'd moss</p>

      <p>The lofty turrets did emboss,</p>

      <p>Array'd in robes of purest white.</p>

      <p>Large snowy folds confin'd her hair,</p>

      <p>And left a polish'd forehead bare.</p>

      <p>O'er her meek eyes, of deepest blue,</p>

      <p>The sable lash long shadows threw;</p>

      <p>Her cheek was delicately pale,</p>

      <p>And seem'd to tell a piteous tale,</p>

      <p>But o'er her looks such patience stole,</p>

      <p>Such saint-like tenderness of soul,</p>

  <h3>DISTANCE FROM THE PLACE OF OUR NATIVITY.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Since I married Palemon, though happy my lot,</p>

      <p>Though my garden is pleasant, and lightsome my cot,</p>

      <p>Though love's smile, like a sunshine, I constantly see,</p>

      <p>Those blessings are all insufficient for me,</p>

      <p>I repine not at labour, I ask not for gold,</p>

      <p>But I want the sweet eyes of my friends to behold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>With Palemon I think o'er the world I could roam,</p>

      <p>Though he liv'd in a desert, would make it my home.</p>

      <p>From him no allurements his Lucy could bribe,</p>

      <p>And, though timid, no dangers, no menaces drive.</p>

      <p>But the heart that can love with devotion so true,</p>

      <p>Is not cold or forgetful, my parents, to you!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh idle declaimers! how is it ye say,</p>

      <p>That affection and tenderness fade and decay?</p>

      <p>Though so easily pain'd, they endure like a gem,</p>

      <p>And the heart and the mind imbibe colour from them!</p>

      <p>In affliction they brighten, in absence refine,</p>

      <p>And are causes of sorrow too sweet to resign.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Low, heavy clouds are hanging on the hills,</p>

      <p>And half-impatient of the sun's approach,</p>

      <p>Shake sullenly their cold and languid wings!</p>

      <p>Oh! it is fine to see his morning beams</p>

      <p>Burst on the gloom, while, in disorder'd flight,</p>

      <p>The shuddering, mournful vapours steal away;</p>

      <p>Like the tenacious spirit of a man,</p>

      <p>Shrinking from the loud voice of cheerfulness,</p>

      <p>When it breaks in, so sadly out of tune,</p>

      <p>Upon his quiet musing, and dispels</p>

      <p>The waking dream of a dejected heart:</p>

      <p>The dream I cherish in this solitude,</p>

      <p>In all the wanderings of my little flock,</p>

      <p>That which beguiles my loneliness, and takes</p>

      <p>Its charm and change from the surrounding scene.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh! how unwelcome often are to me</p>

      <p>The gayest, most exhilarating sounds!</p>

      <p>When slow and sickly Memory, tempted forth</p>

      <p>By dint of soft persuasion, brings to light</p>

      <p>His treasures&mdash;and, with childish eagerness,</p>

      <p>Arranges and collects&mdash;then suddenly</p>

      <p>To have him startled by discordance, drag,</p>

      <p>Without discrimination, all away&mdash;</p>

      <p>And with them leap to his deep hollow cave&mdash;</p>

      <p>Not easily to be withdrawn again,</p>

      <p>Grieves one who loves to think of other times,</p>

      <p>To talk with those long silent in the grave,</p>

      <p>And pass from childhood to old age again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Behold this stony rock! whose rifted crest,</p>

      <p>Lets the rough, roaring torrent force a way,</p>

      <p>And, foaming, pour its waters on the vale!</p>

      <p>Behold them tumbling from their dizzy height,</p>

      <p>Like clouds, of more than snowy whiteness, thrown</p>

      <p>Precipitate from heav'n, which, as they fall,</p>

      <p>Diffuse a mist, in form of glory, round!</p>

      <p>This was my darling haunt a long time past!</p>

      <p>Here, when a boy, in pleasing awe, I sate,</p>

      <p>Wistfully silent, with uplifted eye,</p>

      <p>And heart attun'd to the sad, lulling sound</p>

      <p>They made descending. Far below my feet,</p>

      <p>Near where yon little, ruin'd cottage lies,</p>

      <p>Oft, at the pensive hour of even-tide</p>

      <p>I saw young Osborne bearing on his harp,</p>

      <p>And, trusting to an aged mother's care,</p>

      <p>His darkling steps: Beneath that falling beech,</p>

      <p>Whose wide-spread branches touch the water's edge,</p>

      <p>He lov'd to sit, and feel the freshen'd gale</p>

      <p>Breathe cool upon him. <span class="caesura">Then that falling
      beech</span></p>

      <p>Was a young, graceful tree; which, starting up,</p>

      <p>Amid the looser fragments of the rock,</p>

      <p>Rear'd boldly in the air its lofty head,</p>

      <p>While, struggling with the stone, the nervous roots</p>

      <p>Pursued their own direction, elbowing out,</p>

      <p>Their flinty neighbour; who, o'erspread with moss,</p>

      <p>Of varied hues, and deck'd with flow'ring heath,</p>

      <p>That from each fissure hung luxuriant down,</p>

      <p>Became a seat, where, king of all the scene,</p>

      <p>The harper sate, and, in sweet melodies,</p>

      <p>Now like the lark rejoicing at the dawn,</p>

      <p>Now soothing as the nightingale's sad note,</p>

      <p>Hail'd the departing sun, whose golden rays</p>

      <p>Glitter'd upon the surface of the wave,</p>

      <p>And, as a child upon its mother's arm</p>

      <p>Seeks to delay the coming hour of rest,</p>

      <p>Till sudden slumbers steal upon his smiles</p>

      <p>And veil him in a dream of love and joy,</p>

      <p>He seem'd reluctant to withdraw his beams;</p>

      <p>And, rich in roseate beauty, for awhile</p>

      <p>Kept the green waves beneath his glowing head.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Kind, gentle Osborne! half a century</p>

      <p>Has silver'd o'er the crisp and yellow locks</p>

      <p>Of thy young auditor, but memory still</p>

      <p>Grasps the torn record of my weary life.</p>

      <p>And finds full many a page to tell of thee!</p>

      <p>Oh! ye who have a friend ye truly love,</p>

      <p>One whom your hearts can trust, whose excellence</p>

      <p>Was not obtruded boastingly to view,</p>

      <p>But time and happy circumstance reveal'd,</p>

      <p>Rays of quick light upon a diamond</p>

      <p>Which else had lain unnotic'd in the waste!</p>

      <p>Oh! hasten! hasten speedily to pay</p>

      <p>Each debt of fond affection! lock not up</p>

      <p>So cautiously the tribute due to worth!</p>

      <p>Nor let reserve, as I have often done,</p>

      <p>Enslave the sweetest feelings of the soul!</p>

      <p>And hang around them like an envious mist,</p>

      <p>O'er the bright radiance of the morning star,</p>

      <p>Leaving us nothing but a spot of light</p>

      <p>Bereav'd of all its lustre! For my friend,</p>

      <p>He never knew that there was one on earth,</p>

      <p>After a parent felt the touch of death,</p>

      <p>And Love, a weeping pilgrim, turn'd away</p>

      <p>Far from his dwelling&mdash;Oh! he never knew,</p>

      <p>That there was one who would have follow'd him,</p>

      <p>With steady kindness, even to the grave!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Thou dear, neglected friend! to whom I owe</p>

      <p>All that sustains my heart, and makes me think</p>

      <p>The gift of life a blessing, Oh! forgive</p>

      <p>That in thy sorrows, my forgetful tongue</p>

      <p>Spake not of zeal and service; of the debt</p>

      <p>Which gratitude was emulous to pay!</p>

      <p>I might have trimm'd the dying lamp of hope,</p>

      <p>And cheer'd the bitter hours of banishment:</p>

      <p>But Oh! my youth was fearful, and I felt</p>

      <p>So deep an awe of that unspotted worth</p>

      <p>And saint-like gentleness&mdash;such a mistrust</p>

      <p>Of my own powers to tell him what I wish'd,</p>

      <p>That I resisted all my feelings claim'd,</p>

      <p>In anguish I resisted; but a spell</p>

      <p>Hung o'er me and compell'd me to be mute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Methinks I still behold him! tall and fair,</p>

      <p>He had a look so tranquil and so mild,</p>

      <p>That something holy stole upon the sense</p>

      <p>When he appear'd; his language had such power</p>

      <p>In converse, that the hearer, as entranced</p>

      <p>Sate lingering on to listen; while in song,</p>

      <p>Or skill upon the many-stringed harp</p>

      <p>Was never heard his equal! Then he knew</p>

      <p>All our old ballads, all our father's tales,</p>

      <p>All the adventurous deeds of early times,</p>

      <p>The punishment of blood or sacrilege,</p>

      <p>And the reward of virtue, when it seem'd</p>

      <p>Deserted by the world, and left alone,</p>

      <p>A prey to scorn, oppression, contumely</p>

      <p>And all the ills which make the good despair.</p>

      <p>When-e'er we circled round him, one young girl</p>

      <p>Was always present, of a nicer ear,</p>

      <p>And more refin'd perception than the rest.</p>

      <p>Now she was lost in thought, while on her cheek</p>

      <p>Lay silent tears&mdash;and then that cheek grew pale</p>

      <p>In wild amazement&mdash;but, when he began</p>

      <p>To speak of noble deeds, she rais'd her head,</p>

      <p>Bending with looks of mingled awe and love,</p>

      <p>And zealous admiration, on the youth,</p>

      <p>Alone insensible of all around,</p>

      <p>To the soft charm of symmetry and grace,</p>

      <p>The smile intelligent, the look benign,</p>

      <p>And all the outward raiment of the soul.</p>

      <p>Yet, though he saw her not, it was his fate</p>

      <p>To have an inward and discerning sense,</p>

      <p>Which spake of Lora's gentleness and worth.</p>

      <p>He lov'd in her the fondness of his art,</p>

      <p>And taught her many wild and simple airs,</p>

      <p>Suiting the plaintive tenor of her voice,</p>

      <p>Which he would mimic with sweet minstrelsy.</p>

      <p>When she was absent, and with strange delight,</p>

      <p>Repeat her parting words, her kind adieu,</p>

      <p>Or sweetly-spoken promise of return.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And that return was prompt: she linger'd oft</p>

      <p>Till evening wet the ground with heavy dew,</p>

      <p>Or came to take her lesson in the morn,</p>

      <p>Before her father's anxious eyes unclos'd,</p>

      <p>To look upon her beauty with delight,</p>

      <p>And soothe the rugged temper of his soul,</p>

      <p>By views of future grandeur for his child:</p>

      <p>Not thinking that her elegance of mind,</p>

      <p>The modest dignity of humble worth</p>

      <p>Which fits the low-born peasant to become</p>

      <p>A crowned monarch, and to wield with grace</p>

      <p>The golden sceptre, had instructed her</p>

      <p>To feel no paltry jealousy of power,</p>

      <p>No bold aspiring, and no wish beyond</p>

      <p>The bounded confines of her present state:</p>

      <p>Had counsell'd her, that even mines of wealth,</p>

      <p>Could purchase nothing to content the wise,</p>

      <p>Esteem or friendship, tenderness or love:</p>

      <p>That power at best was but a heavy weight;</p>

      <p>If well employ'd, a dubious, unpaid toil,</p>

      <p>If ill, a curse, to tempt men to their fate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Her cheek had often felt the blush of shame,</p>

      <p>At his proud boasting; and her heart had sunk</p>

      <p>At the cold arrogance that scorn'd the poor;</p>

      <p>But she was fain to turn aside, and weep,</p>

      <p>To wring her hands in secret, and to raise</p>

      <p>The eye of silent anguish up to heaven;</p>

      <p>For though he dearly lov'd her, he would ne'er</p>

      <p>Submit to hear a murmur at his will.</p>

      <p>Oft with her heart oppress'd, and her blue eyes</p>

      <p>Full of unshedden tears, she bent her way</p>

      <p>Alone to Osborne's lowly cot, and when</p>

      <p>Her faint voice call'd the fond inquiry forth,</p>

      <p>Would say, "'tis true, my friends, that I am sad,</p>

      <p>Nay sick, with vain repining. O! I wish,</p>

      <p>That I were either indigent myself,</p>

      <p>Or that I had the power, the blessed power</p>

      <p>Of cheering the unhappy! for I want,</p>

      <p>By kindness to prevent the act of guilt,</p>

      <p>And ward the arrows of incroaching Death,</p>

      <p>Who comes, before the time, upon his prey.</p>

      <p>Think that there should be means to stay his wrath,</p>

      <p>To purchase health, life, comfort, innocence,</p>

      <p>And yet those means withholden! <span class="caesura">"O! my
      heart!</span></p>

      <p>It dies with sorrow! and where most I love,</p>

      <p>Sheds all its bitterness; delighting still</p>

      <p>To tell the many miseries that flit</p>

      <p>At times across me! Those I lightly prize</p>

      <p>Partake the sunshine of my happier hours,</p>

      <p>Although I seek them with far less delight!</p>

      <p>The loud laugh dwells not here, the sportive dance,</p>

      <p>The carol of unconscious levity,</p>

      <p>And yet how oft, how willingly I come!"</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Know'st thou not, Lora," cried the youthful sage,</p>

      <p>"That there are things the mind must prize above</p>

      <p>What captivates the senses! That in them</p>

      <p>She feels no interest, and she takes no care!</p>

      <p>Delighted back the ensigns of her power,</p>

      <p>And takes her truant vassals into grace!</p>

      <p>That when thou bring'st to us that wounded mind,</p>

      <p>The grave of many feelings, language is</p>

      <p>As yet too poor to utter, thou canst give</p>

      <p>O! Lora! to the Father of the world,</p>

      <p>A Judge so patient and so merciful.</p>

      <p>That he refuses not the latest sigh.</p>

      <p>Nor suffers sorrow but as means to save,</p>

      <p class="i2">I love the thunder's break.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And oft beneath our castle tow'rs,</p>

      <p class="i2">When tempests rush'd along,</p>

      <p>My steady hand has painted flowers,</p>

      <p>In Hubert's halls, my father's foe,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>My nurse reveal'd the dreadful truth,</p>

      <p>The heavy secret on my heart</p>

      <p>I, who so blithely sung before,</p>

      <p class="i2">So peacefully had slept,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>No longer with an open smile,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>All saw the change, and kindly strove</p>

      <p class="i2">My sadness to relieve;</p>

      <p class="i2">Which could not see me grieve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A painful anger flush'd my cheek,</p>

      <p class="i2">My lip indignant smil'd,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Ellen! when death was drawing nigh,</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>To none, dear friend, but thee," he cried,</p>

      <p class="i2">"Whose love and truth are known,</p>

      <p class="i2">To cherish, as thy own!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I pledg'd my honour, to fulfil</p>

      <p class="i2">My dearest friend's desire!</p>

      <p class="i2">As honour's laws require!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Thy mind, dear Ellen, is the proof</p>

      <p class="i2">Of my paternal care,</p>

      <p class="i2">So excellent and fair.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Then why that cloud upon thy brow,</p>

      <p>That something which we must not know,</p>

      <p class="i2">That cold and altered eye?</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Why must thy proud, suspicious air,</p>

      <p class="i2">Give every heart a pain?</p>

      <p>Why must my son, my Edgar bear</p>

      <p class="i2">Unmerited disdain?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I hung my bead, my fault'ring tongue</p>

      <p class="i2">In feeble murmurs spoke,</p>

      <p class="i2">I shudder'd at his look.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And thus, bewildered with my woes,</p>

      <p class="i2">I faint and careless rove;</p>

      <p>For oh! I cannot dwell with those</p>

      <p class="i2">I must no longer love."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Fair lady, calm that anxious heart,</p>

      <p class="i2">And to my voice attend!</p>

      <p>Thy father died by Hubert's dart,</p>

      <p class="i2">And yet he was his friend.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For Lancaster Sir Philip rose,</p>

      <p class="i2">And many a Yorkist slew;</p>

      <p>Till, singling him amidst his foes,</p>

      <p class="i2">Lord Hubert's arrow flew.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But soon we saw the victor stand</p>

      <p class="i2">Beside, in sorrow drown'd;</p>

      <p>And soon Sir Philip took the hand,</p>

      <p class="i2">Which gave the deadly wound.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"My friend, unweeting was thy aim,</p>

      <p class="i2">And is by me forgiv'n,</p>

      <p>But oh! one sacred oath I claim,</p>

      <p class="i2">In sight of men, and heav'n!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh! promise with a father's zeal,</p>

      <p class="i2">My Ellen to protect!</p>

      <p>Nor let her like an orphan feel</p>

      <p class="i2">Dependence, and neglect!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And then, almost without regret,</p>

      <p class="i2">I can my charge resign;</p>

      <p>For, during life, I never met</p>

      <p class="i2">So true a heart as thine."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lord Hubert pledg'd his sacred word,</p>

      <p class="i2">He wept, and, kneeling, swore,</p>

      <p>In England ne'er to wield a sword,</p>

      <p class="i2">Or shoot an arrow more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
