# reads LOC categories & creates a topics list with subtopics lists
# each LOC mark is a first letter, a second letter or a number, then a text description.

# there are two files: LOCtopics, ~48k lines, and LOCcategories, ~450 lines (first two letters)

# the allLOCsubjects class makes a tree: 25 first-letter "orders". 
#   each order contains the two-letter combinations in that section: "families"
#   each family contains all the LOCcategories in that topic in a list:"genus"es
#   each genus contains a list of books, from which we get a list of authors. 

# The library's book ordering is order-family-genus-author-title
# Books with multiple topic strings occur that many times. 
# The call numbers are generated by concatenating the two letters, a genus number, 
# author name up to 10 characters, book title up to 10 characters
# (what about multiple editions? what about re-scans?)


# differences from brick & mortar libraries
# 1) as many copies as you like of everything=> books have multiple locations. 
# 2) no loaning => no need for unique IDs (editions, etc) 
# 3) updating every single classification is as easy as re-running the script



############### steps to make the catalog

# load the orders & families from the LOCtopics 
# -- init the orders in one pass & set marks
# -- second pass, make families in orders & set those marks

# load the geni from LOCcategories
# -- init into arrays in families

# step through books
# -- make a book, then a minibook
# -- -- save minibook in array indexed by gutenID
# -- -- for each topic/genus
# -- -- -- find topic (or add new) -- mark as not made from list!!

# make marks for each genus

# step through books by gutenID
# -- for each author
# -- -- for each topic
# -- -- -- find topic; add to topic list for that book
# -- -- -- add book to genus

# for each book in each genus, sort, assign marks
#  -- copy marks for each genus/author/title into gid-indexed book list

# for each book in gid list, for each mark, copy into genus 

# output the list of marks

# statistics- gathering: break into ~10k chunks of text
# make HTML for order/family/genus
# generate HTML? PHP? for books, sections, 
# HTML for each book contains related books: all by that author, all in that subject.


# will have one of these per book, stored in a gid-indexed array,
# and, multiply, in the order/fam/gen tree
